Geometric deformations. 

While perturbation techniques are used in analysis,
Groebner deformations of left ideals in Weyl algebras are used as algebraic analogues to classical analytic techniques. 

Will focus on Groebner deformations of high-dimensional Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric systems.
